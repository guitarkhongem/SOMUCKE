Important tips:

1.This program supports the following data recording mode:
	
	a)Slope Distance Mode (SD) 			 ------ FC-5 / FC-2 
	  Horizontal Distance Mode (HD)			 	       GTS-6
	  Vertical Angle Mode (VA)				       CR-1

	b)Coordinate Mode (XYZ) data			 ------ FC-5 only

2.The selection of recording mode depended merely on survey application. In
  most cases, user will select SD mode because it gives all measurements.
